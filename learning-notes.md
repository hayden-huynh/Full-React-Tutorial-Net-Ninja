# Creating a React App

```
npx create-react-app <project name>
```

- As `npx` is part of Node.js so it should be installed

# React Components and Templates

- Each React component is equivalent to a UI compoment (e.g. nav bar, side column, main body) and consists of the Template and the Logic for that component.
- `App.js` is an example of a React component, which is actually a JS function returning its UI template written in JSX.
- `App.js` is usually the root component - the first component to be rendered by React and sits at the top of the component tree
